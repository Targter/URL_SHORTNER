BUN + ELYSIA IS THE BEST COMBINATION 

WHILE 
NODEJS WITH EXPRESS 


WE CAN USE THE EXPRESS + BUN .. BUT 
EXPRESS IS THE NODEJS FRAMEWORK 
SO IT WILL INTERNALLY CALL THE NODE API 

SO IT MEANS .. 
NO PERFORMANCE BENEFITS .. 



SO BEST WAY TO USE BUN WITH ELYSIA .. 
we can create the backend application with bun only.. with serve but it will not longer use or in benefits and not optimized.. 




bun create elysia app  ..
